# 📊 Task 8 – Simple Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is part of my **Data Analyst Internship (Task 8)**, where the goal is to design a simple, clean, and interactive sales dashboard using **Power BI**.

---

## ✅ Objective:
To create a dashboard that visually presents **sales performance by Month, Region, and Category**, using a dataset like Superstore_Sales.csv.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- Power BI
- Superstore Sales dataset
- Data cleaning (Power Query)

---

## 📌 Steps Followed:

1. **Imported the dataset** into Power BI.
2. **Transformed the `Order Date`** to a "Month-Year" format.
3. **Created the following visuals:**
   - 📈 **Line Chart** – Monthly Sales Trend
   - 📊 **Bar Chart** – Sales by Region
   - 🍩 **Donut Chart** – Sales by Category
4. **Added a slicer** for Region to make the report interactive.
5. **Used color formatting** to highlight top-performing categories and regions.

## 🔍 Key Insights:

1. ✅ The **West region** had the highest total sales.
2. 💼 The **Technology category** was the best-performing segment, contributing the most revenue.
3. 📆 **December** was the peak sales month, likely due to end-of-year demand.
